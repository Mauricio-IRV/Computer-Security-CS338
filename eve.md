### Diffie Hellman
---

- Figure out the shared secret agreed upon by Alice & Bob. This will be an integer.

- Show your work. How did you finder out the shared secret?

- Show precisely where in your process you would have failed if the integers involved were much larger.

---

1. In order to determine the shared secret we first need to determine what the random b generated by Bob was. To do this we would ideally invert $$ g^b mod p $$

### RSA
---

- Figure out the encrypted message sent from Alice to Bob.

- Show your work. Exactly how did you figure out the message? (You should include an explanation of how the message from Alice to Bob is encoded. That is, how does Alice's intended message (whatever manner of message it may be) correspond to the integers in the plaintext that you end up with after decrypting the encrypted message?)

- Show precisely where in your process you would have failed if the integers involed were much larger.

- Explain, briefly, why the message encoding Alice used would be insecure even if Bob's keys involved larger integers.
